 * I made this function in such a way that if you change any text on the form, or need to change the Google Drive file/folder location, you can do so without the risk of breaking the script.
 * The 'file' variable holds the value retrieved from a URI like so: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LJE4avVjdC3Infb5AQRarDTAFBVohLY35c7R5syfOy8/edit. The file id is between '/d' and '/edit'
 * The 'folder' variable is the same: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1jMM5cN-2U9xyqmiLsuLkfOdc-ywW2mau. The folder id is after '/folders'/, and before any other possible content
 * Gillian: If you change any text on the Google Form, this script will break. It will still generate a contract document, but will have a {{x}} somewhere, where x is any text.
 * To fix the broken form, you have to go to the specific section referenced by the variable A[5-23] in the Google Form and copy/paste the text from that section into the string in 'form_data[]'
 * Be sure to keep the '' characters around the string of text otherwise the script will not be able to fetch the data from the Google Form.
